       "(\"venous thromboembolism ( vte ) comprising of deep vein thrombosis ( dvt ) and pulmonary embolism ( pe ) can result in significant mortality , morbidity , and healthcare expenditure . \\n approximately , one - third of patients with symptomatic vte manifests pe , whereas two - thirds manifest dvt alone . \\n both dvt and pe can be clinically silent ( asymptomatic ) and hence not suspected . \\n if undiagnosed , asymptomatic vte can lead to chronic venous disease or recurrent vte and long - term debilitating sequelae such as postthrombotic syndrome and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension . \\n vte is not only disabling but also prolongs hospital stay and increases the cost of treatment . \\n along with myocardial infarction and arrhythmia ( due to electrolyte imbalance ) , pe is one of the commonest causes of sudden unexplained deaths in hospitalized patients . \\n it is estimated that 20 million cases of lower extremity dvt occur in the usa alone . \\n the prevailing notion that the incidence of vte in asians is less than that in the western population has been disproved by recent studies . \\n the incidence of postoperative dvt in indian patients undergoing major lower limb surgery is as high ( 43.2% and 60% patients in the groups with and without prophylaxis , respectively ) as seen in the western world . \\n given the growing burden of vte in india and lack of substantial indian data on characteristics of vte patients , use of diagnostics tools , prophylaxis , treatment options , and clinical outcomes in vte , there was a need to systematically collect such data . \\n data on patient characteristics , clinical outcomes , predictors of mortality in acute dvt , management strategies and temporal trends in vte . \\n the intent was to collect and provide data that would reflect actual day - to - day clinical practice , rather than results of highly controlled clinical trials with restricted study populations and imposed experimental intervention . \\n consecutive medical records of inpatients and outpatients between january 2006 and december 2010 , meeting eligibility criteria ( confirmed diagnosis of acute or acute - on - chronic dvt by doppler ultrasound scan and/or pe by chest computed tomography scan , pulmonary angiography or v / q scan ) were identified and collected from the general medical records and/or radiology departments at each of the three participating hospitals . \\n hospital data were used to obtain the total number of patients who were annually registered at the hospital from 2006 to 2010 . \\n data were processed and analyzed using sas ( version 9.1 , statistical analysis system ) . for the purpose of analysis ,  acute - on - chronic \\n descriptive statistics were used to present patient characteristics , management strategies , and clinical outcomes of patients . \\n annual incidence rates ( 95% ci ) of vte per 100,000 hospital registrations over a period of 5 years were reported for each site . \\n fisher 's exact test was used to determine differences in the incidence of acute dvt ( pe ) over the years 20062010 . \\n armitage trend test was used to examine the direction ( positive or negative ) of the trend . as primary analyses \\n the remaining 41% ( 393/949 ) medical records were not included because they did not satisfy the inclusion criteria . \\n data from seven patients were excluded as there was no radiologically confirmed diagnosis of pe . \\n a total of 64% ( 352/549 ) patients had acute dvt without pe , 23% ( 124/549 ) had acute dvt with pe , and 13% ( 73/549 ) had pe . \\n eighty -

world clinical practice . in contrast with the western data in which vte is predominantly a disease of older age , 44% patients in our study were between 40 and 59 years of age while 34% were below 40 years , particularly those with pe . in a study from north india , \\n men constituted 70% of our registry , more than those reported from vellore registry ( 48% ) , but similar to those reported in the endorse ( epidemiologic international day for the evaluation of patients at risk for vte in the acute hospital care setting ) study ( 69% ) . \\n one of the reasons for this could be significantly high levels of homocysteine ( thrombophilia marker ) in males as compared to females as reported in an indian study . \\n fewer indian women use oral contraceptives and postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy , which are known to be risk factors for thrombosis . \\n this is supported by the fact that only 1% of women in this registry reported the use of oral contraceptives , and none reported use of hormonal replacement therapy . \\n a total of 28% of the overall referrals were from cardiologists . the majority ( 82% ) of the referrals were from medical rather than surgical ( 15% ) specialties as against a referral rate of 93% from surgeons at vellore . \\n our finding complements that from the endorse study in which 55% of the medical patients at risk of vte had cardiovascular disease . majority ( 53% ) of patients in our study had co - morbid cardiovascular disease including diabetes mellitus ; it is possible that these patients visited a cardiologist for their cardiovascular ailment ( s ) and were then referred by the cardiologist to vascular disease specialist ( investigator ) . \\n most ( 89% ) of these patients had swelling of the ( lower ) limb . \\n it is possible that these patients may not have felt the need to visit a specialist for a symptom like  swelling of limb ,  instead visited their family physician . \\n it is very encouraging to know that family physicians suspected dvt in these situations and referred the patient to a specialist . \\n patients with a history of vte are about 8 times more likely to develop a new episode during a subsequent high - risk period compared with patients without a history of dvt or pe . \\n prior history of dvt was the most ( 34% ) common risk factor in patients who had only dvt , whereas past history of pe , trauma , and immobilization for more than 3 days were the most common risk factors in patients who had only pe . \\n our results ( major lower limb surgery as a risk factor in 3% patients ) appear to be consistent with those reported in the endorse study , which reported dvt in 4.4% patients undergoing major lower limb surgery . \\n other studies from india have reported a dvt incidence rate ranging from 8% to 20% in major lower limb surgery . \\n however , in our study , only 7% of patients had malignancy as a predisposing factor . among the malignancies , genitourinary cancer had the highest incidence ( 45% ) . \\n hypertension ( 25% ) was the most common co - morbidity followed by diabetes mellitus ( 19% ) in this patient population . \\n in addition , obesity ( 11% ) was a common risk factor in dvt complicated by pe . \\n our findings support an asian ( korean ) study that demonstrated prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in 48% patients with vte . \\n co - morbid neurological disease ( other than stroke ) and ventilator dependency were also commonly found in patients with dvt ( 10% ) and pe ( 11% ) respectively . \\n both these conditions immobilize patients for prolonged periods of time , predisposing them to vte . \\n venography and pulmonary angiography are the gold standard for diagnosis of dvt and pe respectively . in our study \\n , venography was used in just 4% patients and pulmonary angiography in less than one - third of the patients . \\n perhaps the relatively high cost of these tests and limited availability of such procedures may be the limiting factors . \\n overall , most ( 93% ) patients were managed as inpatients ( 39% diagnosed with vte during hospital stay and 54% admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of vte ) . \\n a mean duration of hospitalization of 79 days after diagnosis of vte is supported by published data . in selected low - risk patients , outpatient treatment of dvt and pe may be considered . \\n this approach was observed in a small proportion ( 7% ) of patients who were managed on an outpatient basis , nearly all ( 97% ) of whom had only dvt . \\n the reported prevalence of postsurgical vte in our study ( 15% ) was half of that ( 30% ) reported in vellore registry . \\n this could be explained by higher referral rate from surgeons at vellore compared to that of our sites . \\n most ( 40% ; 32/81 ) dvt cases were diagnosed between 2 and 6 postoperative weeks , but pe in most cases ( 70% ; 7/10 ) was diagnosed during the first postoperative week . \\n we notice that acute dvt complicated by pe was less ( 6% ; 7/124 ) frequently diagnosed during the postoperative period as against 18% ( 64/352 ) and 14% ( 10/73 ) of acute dvt alone and pe alone , respectively . \\n the use and duration of anticoagulants in our registry appears to be consistent with the american college of chest physicians treatment guidelines , which recommend at least 5 days of initial anticoagulation with parenteral anticoagulation ( lmwh , fondaparinux , intravenous ufh , or subcutaneous ufh ) and at least 3 months of long - term anticoagulation treatment with vitamin k antagonist . \\n bleeding is the most serious complication of anticoagulation treatment and is a major concern for clinicians particularly as the patient 's age advances . in this registry , \\n anticoagulant treatment was needed to be stopped because of bleeding in only 2% of the study population . \\n the prospective reite registry has reported a rate of 3% for major / fatal bleeds . \\n thus , the fear of bleeding complications , which decreases the use of anticoagulant treatment , appears to be minimal . \\n dvt complicated by pe ( 60% ) and pe alone ( 75% ) were more frequently shifted to intensive care unit than those who had dvt alone ( 25% ) . similar to published data in which hospital readmission rate for vte was 5% for primary and 14% for secondary diagnosis , we report a hospital readmission rate of 6% ; however we do not know the cause for readmission . \\n the death rate was 7% among those diagnosed with vte during hospital stay as against a rate of 1% among those who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of vte . \\n over 90% of patients treated on an outpatient basis obtained symptomatic relief with treatment . in our study , the hospital discharge rate ( 97% ) was more than triple and death rate was a quarter of that reported by pandey et al . \\n ( hospital discharge rate 31% and death rate 16% ) at a university hospital in delhi . \\n our data show a significant increase in acute dvt ( pe ) from 2006 to 2010 . \\n this can be explained by the increased awareness of vte in india as well as the advent of better diagnostic modalities , such as duplex ultrasonography becoming more readily available and accepted . \\n although there was no significant change in the number of pe cases from 2006 to 2010 , the burden of pe is almost double ( 13% of all vte ) of 7% , rate reported at christian medical college , vellore during a 10-year period from 1996 to 2005 . \\n our finding is consistent with a study from north india that reported a 16% incidence of pe in adult medical autopsies . \\n this study has the expected limitations of any retrospective review including the availability of complete records for all patients , although a robust review of the data on medical charts was conducted . \\n controlling for bias and confounders is difficult as there is no randomization and no blinding . \\n follow - up data of patients after hospital discharge were not available . in cases of death , \\n further , the clinic charts reviewed in this study included a mix of those from vascular surgery and hematology departments , limiting the generalizability of the study results . despite these limitations , \\n this study provides large amount of useful information in a short span of time on patient characteristics , clinical outcomes , management strategies , and temporal trends in vte , based on  real world \\n data that reflect actual day - to - day clinical practice over a period of 5 years across three sites in india . \\n we believe that this information will serve as a guide in the optimal implementation of vte prophylaxis and treatment , to improve patient outcomes and to decrease the occurrence of vte in india . \\n real world data reflecting actual day - to - day clinical practice in vte over a period of 5 years across three sites in india showed that vte is not uncommon in indian patients and that acute dvt was responsible for the substantial burden of vte . \\n we believe that this information will serve as a guide in the optimal implementation of vte prophylaxis and treatment , to improve patient outcomes and to decrease the occurrence of vte in india . \\n liesel c. dsilva is and dr . sadhna j. joglekar was full -
