observations indicate that the simplistic expectation that increased ingestion of neurotransmitter precursors will increase excretion of the mature neurotransmitters in the urine is frequently not

kidney.8,9 most of the serotonin or dopamine found in the urine is synthesized in the kidney.912 therefore , the excreted neurotransmitters must be synthesized in the kidneys and escape reabsorption into the blood in order to be excreted in the urine .", "most of the serotonin formed by the kidneys is typically catabolized2 or reabsorbed and not excreted in the urine.8,11,13 alternatively , dopamine synthesized in the kidney is secreted across the apical surface into the urine14 probably by an organic cation transporter9,15 resulting in greater urinary than interstitial dopamine concentrations.12,13 larger doses of tyrosine and 5-htp have been observed to increase both urinary dopamine and serotonin excretion.1618 the array of catabolic and reabsorptive events probably accounts for the far more complex responses than expected to 5-htp or tyrosine ingestion observed in this study . in spite of the complex sequence of renal events accounting for the appearance of neurotransmitter in urine , the presence of opposing responses ( ie , phases 1 and 3 ) does not seem possible without a direct effect of either the precursors or the formed neurotransmitters to cause an aberration in the series of events leading to the presence of urinary neurotransmitters . based on a large volume of studies in the literature ,", "it is likely that administration of 5-htp increases the synthesis of serotonin within the kidney.2,3,8 transporters for serotonin then transfer it into the blood stream to prevent it from being excreted in the urine .", "the phase 1 response we observed for serotonin could be explained by either a neurotransmitter - induced allosteric alteration of a reabsorptive transporter to increase activity or an induction of the synthesis of the transporter .", "increased transport of the neurotransmitters out of the region of the nephron would theoretically reduce urinary excretion of the neurotransmitter , as observed in phase 1 . if the alteration or induction were great enough , essentially all of the neurotransmitter would be reabsorbed and little or none would appear in the urine , as observed in phase 2 .", "a conversion to phase 3 would be possible if the supply of neurotransmitter eventually increased enough to saturate the transport process and result in spillage of neurotransmitter into the urine .", "all three phases have been observed in the same individual and the three phases could represent different stages of renal processing of 5-htp .", "we currently have no evidence explaining the different phases and the potential for increased activity or induction of neurotransmitter transporters merely appears to be the most likely possibility explaining these observations at this point in time .", "this scenario probably necessitates either an inhibition of dopamine secretion into the nephron lumen or a reduction in renal dopamine synthesis .", "two reports indicate that newly synthesized dopamine is normally secreted into the nephron,12,13 thus an inhibition of this secretion could account for the inhibitory effect .", "it is likely that tyrosine could interfere with the secretion of dopamine into the lumen of the nephron but we are unaware of any reports supporting this site of action .", "tyrosine appears to be an unlikely inhibitor of renal dopamine synthesis because it is widely recognized as a dopamine precursor .", "however , tyrosine suppresses l - dopa uptake into proximal tubule cells14,19 and l - dopa uptake is required for renal dopamine synthesis.20 l - dopa is the immediate precursor to dopamine in the synthetic pathway ; therefore , inhibition of its uptake could impair dopamine synthesis .", "proximal tubule cells accumulate tyrosine14 but the kidney lacks extraneuronal tyrosine hydroxylase1,21,22 and can not convert it to dopamine .", "thus , tyrosine could have a paradoxical inhibition of dopamine synthesis in the kidney by suppressing l - dopa uptake into proximal tubule cells .", "an alternative scenario potentially accounting for phase 3 responses to tyrosine involves the peripheral conversion of tyrosine to l - dopa in neuronal tissue .", "the l - dopa entering the kidney could serve as a precursor to dopamine and result in increased dopamine secretion observed in phase 3 .", "the observation of the inhibitory ( ie , phase 1 ) response to tyrosine has not been reported previously .", "a plethora of reports indicate that phase 3 stimulatory effects of tyrosine on urinary dopamine excretion is the predominant response in most studies in rats4,22,23 and protein has been widely used as a tyrosine source to increase dopamine excretion in humans.24 it is possible that the phase 1 response to tyrosine in humans has not been noted previously because of the limited number of studies specifically investigating tyrosine effects on human dopamine excretion .", "the novel observations noted in this study include a somewhat variable relationship between ingested 5-htp and urinary serotonin excretion and the unexpected influence of tyrosine to reduce urinary dopamine excretion .", "the description of the three phases demonstrating the relationship between 5-htp and urinary serotonin excretion is also novel and probably is a reflection of serotonin reabsorption in the kidney .", "the consistent and statistically discernable ability of tyrosine to dampen fluctuations in urinary dopamine excretion is also noteworthy .", "these processes might be reflective of similar processes occurring in other organs and suggest that urine sampling for neurotransmitters requires multiple samples to determine the direction of the response and , potentially , the adequacy of dosing ."]}

main objective pursued by the reform in providing additional resources to new model practices was precisely to improve continuity of care , especially among individuals with chronic diseases [ 11 , 12 ] . a possible explanation for this result could be that financial incentives to enrollment of patients with chronic diseases were extended to all phc organizations , thus offsetting the advantage enjoyed up to that point by fmgs .", "another explanation may be increased provision of services by nurses in fmgs and ncs that are not included in our measures of continuity .", "these findings

integrated model ,  which matched the attributes of the ideal type of fmgs that were to be implemented at that time , emerged as the model with the greatest potential to concomitantly achieve high levels of accessibility and continuity for patients with chronic diseases .", "it could be that the reform had an effect on both phc organizations that have become fmgs or ncs and those that have not changed their status .", "it was not possible with our data to test that spillover effect hypothesis . according to rothman and wagner ,", "the future of primary healthcare largely depends on ability to improve healthcare delivery to meet the needs of chronically ill patients .", "the chronic care model provides six interrelated components for achieving such change among which is delivery system redesign .", "this last condition does not seem to have been met in the implementation of new phc models in quebec .", "a recent report of the auditor general of quebec to the national assembly casts a critical look at the implantation of fmgs and ncs .", "it explains the relative failure of these phc organizations to fully attain the objectives established by the ministry of health and social services by many factors , notably the absence of clear rules , guidelines , and incentives and , above all , the lack of control of the ministry and the regional agencies on the process of implementation .", "this means that several new phc practices received complementary funding without respecting all the components of the contractual engagement .", "howe institute underlines that important factors associated with the slow implementation of fmgs are the low registration rate of patients and the deficient development of teamwork .", "the findings of our study concur with those of other studies and support concerns expressed by analysts .", "the use of difference -

vegf agents , bevacizumab and ranibizumab , have enhanced the management of exudative amd.2 however , the safety profile of these drugs continues to undergo scrutiny , and noninfectious intraocular inflammation is a known adverse effect of both drugs.1 a retrospective case series of nearly 2000 injections reported no significant difference between the incidence of post - injection anterior uveitis ( 1.57% bevacizumab vs 1.38% ranibizumab ; p > 0.80 ) or panuveitis ( 0.39% vs 0.41% ; p = 1.0).3 however , randomized prospective trials comparing the rates of uveitis between ranibizumab and bevacizumab are lacking , leading some authors to question whether the complication rates are truly similar.4,7 although underpowered to compare this relatively rare outcome , the 1-year clinical trial results from the comparison of age - related macular degeneration treatment trials reported anterior uveitis in < 1% of study eyes receiving either treatment.8 in retrospect , we believe that the first case was bevacizumab - related anterior uveitis that was originally misdiagnosed .", "amd treatment later resumed uneventfully with ranibizumab and was then switched to bevacizumab for maintenance therapy .", "the anterior uveitis promptly relapsed . to our knowledge , this is the first report in the literature to describe recurrent bevacizumab - related anterior uveitis following a retrial of intravitreal bevacizumab .", "the second patient likely experienced bevacizumab - related anterior uveitis after previously tolerating the medication without difficulty , which has been reported.9 his case is unique in that he was receiving bilateral bevacizumab injections , yet developed only unilateral anterior uveitis .", "both cases corroborate reports from raja et al10 and georgopoulos et al14 describing the safe administration of intravitreal ranibizumab after bevacizumab - related uveitis .", "the etiology of this drug - induced uveitis is speculative at best , since it occurs rarely and there is no histopathologic data with which to correlate the phenomenon .", "the following mechanisms have been proposed : ( 1 ) toxic response to the drug or excipients ; ( 2 ) direct blood - aqueous or blood - retinal barrier compromise by drug or excipients ; ( 3 ) immune response to the drug or excipients ; and ( 4 ) rebound inflammation secondary to vegf suppression.11 the excipients of both preparations are nearly identical : trehalose dihydrate , sodium phosphate , polysorbate 20 , and sterile water ( histidine hydrochloride  in ranibizumab only ) , which makes it more difficult to implicate them in a differential immune response", ". moreover , there are no reported cases of hypersensitivity to any of these excipients in the literature .", "alternatively , this reaction may occur as an immunologic response to the fc protein portion of the full - length antibody molecule itself ; ranibizumab is an fab fragment whereas bevacizumab is a full - length antibody ( fab and fc ) derived from the same parent molecule .", "this is an attractive explanation since other drugs , such as heparin , provoke a differential immune response based on antigenic load .", "unfractionated heparin has a higher propensity to cause heparin - induced - thrombocytopenia than low - molecular weight heparin , presumably due to the larger size of the full heparin molecule and its enhanced ability to form immunogenic complexes with other platelet factors.12 the exact immunologic mechanism underlying these cases of uveitis is difficult to ascertain without histopathologic data , though a delayed - type hypersensitivity reaction seems possible given the several - day lapse in time between exposure to bevacizumab and the onset of uveitis symptoms .", "interestingly , reports in the cancer literature show that infusions of monoclonal antibodies such as bevacizumab cause immediate hypersensitivity reactions in the majority of cases , though delayed - type reactions can be seen in up to 30% of patients.13 aside from the obvious difference in molecular size between ranibizumab and bevacizumab , it is also possible that differences in drug production could explain the variation in immunogenicity.14 bevacizumab is harvested as a glycosylated product of human ovarian cancer cells , whereas ranibizumab is a non - glycosylated product of bacterial metabolism .", "the glycosylation of bevacizumab creates more potential immunogenic sites compared to the non - glycosylated ranibizumab , which could translate into a higher propensity for bevacizumab to cause inflammatory reactions .", "furthermore , it is interesting to speculate on how the variable dosing regimens for bevacizumab and ranibizumab may contribute to the development of inflammatory complications .", "the predominant anti - vegf dosing schedules used for amd treatment include fixed monthly injections ,  treat and extend , and as - needed ( pro re nata [ prn ] ) injections based on symptoms and oct findings .", "we could not find anything in the literature to suggest that one dosing regimen may result in more complications than another , though it would seem reasonable to postulate that more frequent exposure to a drug could result in a higher likelihood of it causing inflammatory/ immunogenic complications .", "data from the second year of the comparison of age - related macular degeneration treatment trial may help to more fully elucidate the role that anti - vegf dosing schedules play in predisposing patients to inflammatory ocular complications . despite our conjecture regarding the enhanced immunogenic potential of bevacizumab over ranibizumab , a large retrospective study failed to detect a significant difference in the rates of uveitis between the two drugs.3 nevertheless", ", bevacizumab has not been subjected to nearly the same scrutiny ( in the form of rigorous clinical trials ) as ranibizumab , and thus safety data for bevacizumab is relatively lacking.4 the results of future prospective randomized trials comparing the efficacy and side - effect profile of ranibizumab to bevacizumab might help to more definitively answer the questions surrounding the inflammatory sequelae of intravitreal ranibizumab and bevacizumab injections ."]}
